Bubble-game is a game that tests the player's visual perception and reaction speed. The game consists of a screen with 50 bubbles, each with a number from 1 to 50. The game randomly selects a target number and displays it on the top of the screen. The player has to find and click on the bubble that matches the target number as quickly as possible. The game keeps track of the number of correct clicks and the time elapsed. The game ends when either the time runs out or the player clicks on a wrong bubble. The game then shows the player's score and rank based on their performance.
